        <h2>🔍 Key Insights & Inspirations from Week 6</h2>
        <p>
            In Week 6, we explored how data can be manipulated, visualized, and transformed into interactive media art.
            The discussions around
            <strong>Data Networks</strong>, <strong>Commodification</strong>, and <strong>Data Physicalisation</strong>
            helped me reflect on how deeply data is embedded in our daily lives—and how artists can creatively respond
            to that.
        </p>

        <!-- === Data Networks & Commodification === -->
        <div class="insight-section">

            <div class="insight-text">
                <h3>🧠 Data Networks & Commodification</h3>
                <p>
                    We live in a world where our digital behavior is constantly being tracked, commodified, and sold—as
                    we click, scroll, and pause. Most of the time, we are unknowingly giving away personal data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This reminds me of a recent moment when I asked ChatGPT,
                    <em>“How much do you know about me?”</em> To my surprise, it responded with accurate details. It
                    genuinely felt like the AI knew me better than I knew myself—which was both fascinating and
                    unsettling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Idea 💡:</strong> Use <code>ml5.js</code> and the webcam to track user behaviors.
                    On the side, display a live table logging every interaction—e.g. <code>wink: 15 times</code>,
                    <code>yawn: 1 time</code> in 1 minute.
                </p>

                <h3>📊 Data Visualization & Physicalization</h3>
                <p>
                    Data doesn't always have to be presented in charts and graphs. It can be embodied, interactive, and
                    spatial. Week 6 encouraged me to explore data in poetic and provocative ways that evoke emotion or
                    tension.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Idea 💡:</strong> Select a region and retrieve its violent crime statistics. Then, animate
                    each data point as a splashing blood droplet. The more crime, the more droplets appear—creating a
                    visual intensity that mirrors real-world discomfort. This transforms raw statistics into a visceral,
                    memorable experience.

            <p>
                During the workshop, I created an interactive sketch where both sound and visuals respond to user
                interaction. When users click the screen, a sound begins playing, and the canvas reacts in real time to
                the audio’s volume using animated shapes and text.
            </p>

            <p>
                This experiment allowed me to explore new features in <code>p5.js</code>, including:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>p5.Amplitude()</code> – Detects and retrieves the current volume level of the audio, which can
                    then be mapped to visual elements such as size, rotation, or movement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>keyPressed()</code> – Enables interaction through keyboard input. In my sketch, pressing the
                    <code>b</code> key dynamically changes the font color, adding a layer of personalisation and
                    control.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This hands-on exercise helped me better understand how sound can shape visual experience in interactive
                media.

                    For this code, I explored the interaction between conditional statements and sound.
                    If the volume is low, it represents a <strong>"calm"</strong> state with a blue background.
                    In contrast, high volume indicates an <strong>"intense"</strong> state, shown with a red background.
                    I also embedded the <code>mousePressed()</code> function we learned in class,
                    allowing users to activate the design by clicking the mouse.

                    background noise that might trigger the animation. To make the text vibrate
                    chaotically, I used my favourite function again: <code>random()</code>,

                <h2><u>🧳 Data in My Bag Activity</u></h2>
                <p>
                    In class, we participated in an interactive exercise where we were asked to unpack all the items
                    from our bags.
                    These items were treated as personal “data”, giving insight into our habits, values, and daily
                    needs. We were then
                    asked to categorize, arrange, and visually present our items in any way that felt meaningful to
                    us.<br><br>
                    This physical arrangement acted as a form of data physicalisation—a way to express personal
                    hierarchy, emotion, and utility through spatial positioning. It made me reflect on how even mundane
                    objects can be interpreted as meaningful data.<br><br>
                    However, it also reminds me of the topic of ethical practices in writing algorithms and data
                    manipulation: What if
                    our data is misinterpreted and used in a wrong way? I think this would make such a cool interactive
                    artwork where
                    users are given a person’s data and start to manipulate it themselves.
